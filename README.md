# ChronoSMART - (Alpha V1)



Revolutionary app for record time in a completely automatic way.
Used for athletic races of 100m, 200m and 400m.

# How to work
We use a Nucleo board [STM32F401](http://www.st.com/en/microcontrollers/stm32f401.html?querycriteria=productId=LN1810) with [HC-SR04](http://www.radiofo.it/files/articoli/sku026931new.pdf) connected with a mobile Android application. 
The application use a database to record the data of the user and all session of the training.

The user must register and log in to the application. You can set up a training session (enabling the Nucleo board to record the time) and can check its timing.
